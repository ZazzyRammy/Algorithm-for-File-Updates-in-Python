  <h1>Algorithm for File Updates in Python</h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    As a security professional at a healthcare company, my task is to update a file containing an allow list of IP
    addresses that are permitted to access restricted content. This involves removing IP addresses listed in the remove
    list from the allow list to maintain the security of patient records.
  </p>

  <h2>Open the Allow List File</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Work with the file here
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>import_file</code> is a variable storing the filename "allow_list.txt". The <code>with</code> statement ensures proper closure of the file after usage. <code>open(import_file, "r")</code> opens the file in read mode ("<code>r</code>"). The file object is stored in the variable <code>file</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Read the File Contents</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
ip_addresses = file.read()
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>file.read()</code> reads the contents of the file and stores it in the <code>ip_addresses</code> variable.
  </p>

  <h2>Convert the String into a List</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split("\n")
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>.split("\n")</code> splits the string into a list of IP addresses, using newline character ("\n") as the delimiter.
  </p>

  <h2>Iterate through the Remove List</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
for element in remove_list:
    # Code to remove IP addresses
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>element</code> is a loop variable representing an IP address from the <code>remove_list</code>.
  </p>

  <h2>Remove IP Addresses from the List</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
if element in ip_addresses:
    ip_addresses.remove(element)
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> The <code>if</code> condition checks if <code>element</code> is in the <code>ip_addresses</code> list. If true, the <code>.remove()</code> method is used to remove <code>element</code> from the list.
  </p>

  <h2>Update the File with Revised IP Addresses</h2>
  <pre><code class="python">
updated_contents = "\n".join(ip_addresses)

with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(updated_contents)
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> <code>"\n".join(ip_addresses)</code> joins IP addresses in the list with newline characters. The file is opened in write mode ("<code>w</code>") to update its contents. <code>.write()</code> method writes the updated contents to the file.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    In this algorithm, I developed a solution for updating an allow list of IP addresses used to control access to sensitive patient records. The algorithm involves opening the allow list file, reading its contents, converting the content into a list of IP addresses, iterating through a remove list of IP addresses to be excluded, removing the specified IP addresses from the allow list, and then updating the file with the revised list. This approach helps maintain data security by ensuring that unauthorized IP addresses are not allowed access to restricted content.
